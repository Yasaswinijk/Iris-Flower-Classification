# Iris-Flower-Classification

##Overview

This repository contains code and resources for classifying iris flowers using linear regression. Linear regression is a simple yet powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used for both regression and classification tasks. In this project, we will use linear regression for the classification of iris flowers into different species based on their petal and sepal measurements.

##Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset. It consists of 150 samples from each of three species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor). For each flower, four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) are measured. The goal is to predict the species of the iris flowers based on these four features.

##Requirements

Python 3.x
NumPy
scikit-learn

##Results

The results of the linear regression model's performance on the Iris dataset will be displayed in the notebook or printed to the console when running the script. You will see metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess the model's classification performance.
